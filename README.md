### Project 1 - Three Short Questions
- [Question 1: Cubic Taxicab Number](ex1/ex1)
  The task for this question was to find and return the closest cubic taxicab number N (integer)
larger or equal to a given input. A cubic taxicab number is the result of adding together two
unique pairs of perfect cubes.
- [Question 2: Catalan's Constant](ex1/ex2) 
  This task was to find two positive integers p and q, such that p/q is the best approximation
to Catalanâ€™s constant G, under the constraint, p + q is less than a positive integer N .
- [Question 3: Sum of Reciprocal Squares with Prime Factors](ex1/ex3) 
  Approximate Dirichlet series for the Liouville function to a reasonable degree of accuracy
